This class can be used to create and print linked lists that remain sorted.
Users can choose to sort this list in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order.
This order can be changed at any time.
Elements can be added and removed by value, as well as by index. There are also
methods especially for removing the head and the tail of the list.
